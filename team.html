Doing MUN has taught me what no textbook could teach: on a smaller scale, a MUN to me is a way to bridge gaps. I believe MUNs are the means through which we, the future, carve out our ideas in the present. Voicing opinion is an integral part of humanity – this is what provides us with individuality.</p>

The environment at Ryan's has given me confidence and encouragement, and made me a persistent and sedulous person. Here, I witnessed my own metamorphosis from being a quiet, shy boy who feared the sight of a mike, to a person who can now preside a committee of hundreds.
