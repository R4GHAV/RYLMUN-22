                                    Model United Nations, also known as Model UN or MUN, is an educational simulation in which students can learn about diplomacy, international relations, and the United Nations. At a MUN conference, students work as the representative of a country, organization, or person, and must solve a problem with other delegates from around the world. MUN teaches participants skills like research, public speaking, debating, writing skills, critical thinking, teamwork, and leadership. Ryan Group of Institutions was one of the first educational groups in India to start practicing MUN among the students on school premises. Students can attend meetings with the diplomatic representatives of the countries they are representing, and other UN and NGO leaders visit committees for dynamic question and answer sessions. Whether you are a beginner or veteran, if you are looking for a highly engaging, immersive experience in the world of international affairs, problem-solving, and diplomacy, RYLMUN is the stage for you.
                                </p>
                                <p>
