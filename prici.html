This powerful quote holds true completely. Being a facilitator of RYLMUN and seeing the abundant knowledge, experience, and success, I can say that it's been one kind of a journey that I'll never forget. I have been with RYLMUN, supporting the students, helping the students to organize everything with full precision, and enhancing each and every inch of the conferences. Seeing the delegates sharing their young thoughts and expressing their hearts to turn the world into a better place, fills me with pride. The EB and the very backbone- the organizing committee of RYLMUN, working hard to ensure the very best outcome is a scene of contentment. So, here's to another fruitful year for me to welcome you all to the 5th Edition of RYLMUN!
